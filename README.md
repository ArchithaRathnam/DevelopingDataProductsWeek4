# DevelopingDataProductsWeek4
Week 4 is all about the Course Project, producing a Shiny Application and reproducible pitch.

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.
